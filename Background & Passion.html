            <b> "As long as I am in the process of doing what I want to do, I do not need self motivation. It is only when I do tedious tasks that I have to throw in some motivational techniques. The more I follow my passion, the more motivated I am. My passion inspires me to motivate people. My passion does not only motivate one but gives some ideas. Passionate people accept their mistakes because they see their mistakes as an avenue to learn." </b>
