         I am someone that thinks carefully before uttering anything to anyone. I always think carefully about the words that I utter because those kind of elements describe one's character. Empathy is the power of connection because is the sensation of experiencing what the other person is going through. Empathy makes one to become capable of creating a psychic and emotional connection with another person to enter another person's mindscape. If a person feels connected to another person's mindset, it is impossible to mistreat them, except unintentionally. A person gets to recoil from their individual suffering.

            Empathy manifests in education as well in between teachers and students. Empathy becomes difficult when there are differences between people regarding culture, language, skin colour, gender and age. Empathy is considered as a motivating factor for unselfish behaviour. Lack of empathy is similar to antisocial behaviour. Having an empathy does not mean one is willing to assist someone but is essential step towards compassionate action.
